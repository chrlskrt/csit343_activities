/*
1. In the S13 folder, create an activity folder and an index.html and index.js file inside of it.
	- Create an index.html file to attach our index.js file
	- Copy the template provided by your Instructor and paste it in an index.js file.
	- Update your local sessions git repository and push to git with the commit message of Add template code s13.
	- Console log the message Hello World to ensure that the script file is properly associated with the html file.
2. Create a JavaScript Function called printOddNumbers that takes in a number as an input and uses loops to output only odd numbers
	- Create a variable called oddNumbers with a string value of "The odd numbers found are the following: "
			- Look up Continue and Break Statements to be able to complete the output for this activity.
	- The loop should print numbers based on a given value.
	- Add an if statement to check if the current number iterated is an even number.
			- If it is, use the continue statement to skip the loop to the next iteration.
			- Else, if the current number is odd, concatenate the number to the oddNumbers variable to create a string with the initial value and the odd numbers found.
	- Create another if statement to check if the current value is greater than 10
			- If it is, use the break statement to stop the loop.
	- Once the loop is complete, return the variable oddNumbers.
