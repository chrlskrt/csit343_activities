INSTRUCTIONS:
2. Create an object for the Adventurer with properties such as: 
    - name => A string representing the adventurer's name.
    - health => A number representing the adventurer’s experience level.
    - level => A number representing how much health the adventurer has.
    - attack => A number representing how much damage the adventurer deals when attacking.
    - inventory => An empty array to store items and loot the adventurer collects during quests.
3. Add "attackMonster" method with an argument of a monster.
    - The method will subtract the adventurer’s attack power from the monster’s health.
    - If the monster's health reaches 0 or less, 
        - The monster will drop a loot. (there is a loot method in the monster object)
        - return: <adventurer> attacks <monster>! + <monster> has been defeated! + <loot>.
    - Else, return: <adventurer> attacks <monster>! + Monster's health is now <monster's health>.

INSTRUCTIONS:
10. Create a Monster object using the Object Construtor with properties such as:
    - name => A string representing the monster's name.
    - level => A number representing the monster's level (used to calculate its attack power).
    - health => A number representing how much health the monster has.
    - attack => A number representing how much damage the monster can deal to the adventurer (calculated as level * 2).
    - loot => A string representing the item(s) that the monster drops when defeated (e.g., 'Wolf Fur').
11. Add an "attackTarget" method for attacking another character:
    - The method will take target(another character, like the adventurer) as an argument.
    - It should subtract the monster’s attack power from the adventurer's health.
    - return: <monster> attacks <target>! + <target> has been defeated!
    - If the target’s health reaches 0 or less, return: <monster> attacks <target>! + <target>'s health is now is <target's health>
12. Add a "dropLoot" method to drop loot when the monster is defeated.
    - Add the loot to the adventurer’s inventory.
    - Return: <monster> drops <loot>. + <adventurer>'s inventory: <inventory>
    - Create a new instance for the monster (ex. Fenrir the Wolf, level 30, health 100, loot 'Wolf Fur')
