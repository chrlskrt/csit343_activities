    1. Create an array named numbers containing 5 random between 1 and 20.

    2. Print the original numbers array before transformation.

    3.Use an array iteration method to transform each number based on the following rules:

        - If the number is even, raise it to the power of its index.

        - If the number is odd, raise it to the power of (index + 1).

    4. Store the transformed values in a new array named transformedNum and print the final result.

    5. Take a screenshot of the console output and send it in the chat.
 
    Expected output:

    Random numbers:

    [2, 19, 13, 4, 5]
 
    Transformed numbers:

    [1, 361, 2197, 64, 3125]

    1. Create an array named students containing three objects. 

       Each object should have the following properties: 

       - name (string)

       - age (number)

       - hobby (string)
 
    2. Use an iteration method to generate a multi-line introduction for each student using template literals.
 
    3. Print each multi-line introduction separately in the browser console.
 
    4. Take a screenshot of the console output and send it in the chat.
 
    Expected Output:

    Array of student objects:

    [

        { name: "Alice", age: 22, hobby: "painting" },

        { name: "Bob", age: 24, hobby: "gaming" },

    Mini Activity #3 (10 mins)
    1. Create an object named employee with the following properties:
        - fullName (John Doe)
        - department (Software Engineering)
        - projects (array of project objects, each with title and duration in months)
            - title: "Inventory System", duration: 6 
            - title: "Mobile Food Delivery App", duration: 8
            - title: "E-commerce Website", duration: 12
        - skills ("JavaScript", "UI/UX", "AWS Cloud Computing")
    2. Destructure the following values from the employee object:
        - Extract fullName and department directly.
        - Extract the first projectâ€™s title and duration.
        - Extract only the last skill from skills using array destructuring.
    3. Swap the first and last project in the projects array using destructuring.
    4. Print the extracted values and the updated projects array to the console.
