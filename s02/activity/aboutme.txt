Charlene 'Charls' Repuesto

I chose to pursue a BS in Computer Science because this career path offers many job opportunities with high salaries. Additionally, there are different types of jobs to choose from, allowing me to explore and find one that suits my skill set.

Currently, aside from attending university classes, I am learning crochet and fuzzy wire crafts as part of my 2025 goals. Additionally, I am working on a simple website using vanilla JavaScript to refresh my knowledge for classes.
