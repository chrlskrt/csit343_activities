1. In the s04 folder, create an activity folder, an index.html file inside of it and link the index.js file.
2. Create an index.js file and console log the message "Hello World" to ensure that the script file is properly associated with the html file.
3. Copy the activity code from your Instructor. Paste the activity code to your index.js file.

4. Create the following variables to store the following company details:

    - Variable Name - Value Data Type:
        - companyName - String
        - companyEmail - String
        - companyContact - Number
        - employees - Array
        - companyAddress - Object

    - The employees array should contain at least 3 employee names as Strings.
    - The companyAddress object should contain the following key-value pairs:
        - street: <value>
        - city: <value>
        - state: <value>

5. Research how to concatenate strings using + operator in Javascript. 

    - Create variable named intro to store a message.
        - Combine the string "Welcome to our company," and the companyName variable.
        - Log the message "Welcome to our company," and your companyName to the console.
        - Example: "Welcome to our company, XYZ Industries!"

6. Research how to determine the data type of each variable.
    - Add the variables of different primitive data types: 

        - Variable Name - Value:
        - str = "Twice"
        - num = 27
        - bool = true
        - arr = ["Dahyun", "Chaeyoung", "Mina"]
        - obj = { twice: "Dahyun" }

    - Use the operator to determine the data type of each variable.
    - Log the result to the console.
